# Finetuning LLMs on the [Go Emotions Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google-research-datasets/go_emotions)

## Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning an OpenAI model to perform fine-grained emotion classification using the Go Emotions dataset. The goal is to adapt a pre-trained language model to accurately identify and classify emotions in textual data.

## About Go Emotions

The [Go Emotions dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/google-research-datasets/go_emotions) is a large-scale dataset developed by Google Research for fine-grained emotion classification. It contains over 58,000 Reddit comments annotated with 27 emotion categories, providing a comprehensive resource for training emotion classification models.
